When clicking the banner configuration link, open the extension popup UI in a small popup window instead of a normal browser tab. Falls back to opening a tab if popup windows are blocked.

## How it's achieved
- Background handler: open_popup resolves the configured popup path from the extension manifest (ction.default_popup) and builds the URL via chrome.runtime.getURL(...).
- Window behavior: attempts chrome.windows.create({ type: 'popup', url, width, height }); if that fails (blocked/error), falls back to chrome.tabs.create({ url }).

## Files changed
- src/background.js (message action open_popup)
