# GitPulse
a chrome extension to inform users of the activity of repo links before you click them. 


## 🚀 Overview

We’ve all been there: you open a promising new repository to explore, contribute, or file an issue… only to discover it’s a dead project. **GitPulse** saves you time by automatically checking repo activity and adding a visible banner to the top of a GitHub repository’s home page.

### metrics that can make a repo inactive

 - some value (is archived )
 - opened PRs greater than blank

## ✨ Features

## 🔁 CI/CD (auto store updates)

This repo includes GitHub Actions workflows:

- **CI** runs on PRs + pushes to `main` (lint + tests).
- **Release** runs on pushes to `main` and builds distributable zips via `scripts/pack.ps1`.

### Automatic publishing (optional)

Publishing only happens when **either**:

- You manually run the workflow (`workflow_dispatch`), **or**
- A push to `main` includes a change to `manifest.json` or `manifest.firefox.json` (i.e., a version bump).

If the required secrets are not configured, publishing is skipped and the workflow only uploads build artifacts.

**Chrome Web Store secrets** (repo settings → Actions → Secrets and variables):

- `CHROME_EXTENSION_ID`
- `CHROME_CLIENT_ID`
- `CHROME_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `CHROME_REFRESH_TOKEN`

**Firefox AMO secrets**:
